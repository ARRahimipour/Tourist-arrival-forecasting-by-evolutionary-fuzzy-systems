# Fuzzy Genetic Prediction System

This project is a fuzzy logic and genetic algorithm-based system for predicting values based on past data. It uses fuzzy rules to create predictions and optimizes these rules using a genetic algorithm.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `scikit-fuzzy`
- `deap`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (if needed) or navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the necessary libraries by running the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the script to execute the fuzzy prediction system. This will define a fuzzy logic control system and optimize it using a genetic algorithm.

```bash
python main.py
